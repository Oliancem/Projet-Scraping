Its unique technology thoroughly examines the structure of complex software systems, with MRI-like precision. It delivers accurate, actionable, and automated views of software architecture, critical flaws, quality grades, sizing metrics, open-source usage, and cloud readiness levels.

CAST Imaging on the other hand is an on-premises product that can run for reverse-engineers all database structures, code components, and interdependencies in custom-built applications. It provides interactive and accurate architecture blueprints, data-call graphs, and end-to-end transaction flows. Context CAST uses a big VMWare infrastructure to build/tests/deploy all CAST products. Jenkins is used for CI/CD and GitLab EE on premise for Git. This huge infrastructure requires multiple Jenkins servers (6), more than 200 Jenkins slaves, 2000 Jenkins jobs.
